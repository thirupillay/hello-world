#hello world
# water can flow like water or crash like waves
#Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless â€” like water. 
#Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle;
#You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.
